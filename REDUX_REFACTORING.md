# Redux Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring of the Airport task management application to use Redux Toolkit with a normalized state structure.

## Overview

The application has been refactored to use Redux Toolkit for state management, replacing the previous approach that used React's useState hooks and a stack-based navigation system. The new implementation uses a normalized state structure that provides better performance, maintainability, and a foundation for future features like undo/redo functionality.

## Key Changes

### 1. Normalized State Structure

The task data is now stored in a normalized structure:

```typescript
interface TaskState {
  byId: { [id: string]: Task };
  childrenMap: { [parentId: string]: string[] };
  currentTaskId: string | null;
  editingTaskId: string | null;
}
```

This structure:
- Stores each task only once in the `byId` object
- Maintains parent-child relationships in the `childrenMap`
- Tracks the current navigation position with `currentTaskId`
- Tracks the task being edited with `editingTaskId`

### 2. Redux Store Implementation

- **Task Slice**: Implements reducers for all task operations (add, edit, remove, reorder)
- **Selectors**: Provides efficient access to derived data from the normalized state
- **Redux Hooks**: Custom hooks for typed access to the Redux store

### 3. Component Updates

- **App Component**: Updated to use Redux for state management
- **TaskListViewRedux**: New component that connects to Redux store
- **Data Conversion**: Handles conversion between normalized state and component-expected format

### 4. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Tests for reducers, selectors, and components
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for the complete Redux flow

```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All application state is now managed in Redux
2. **Improved Performance**: Normalized state structure reduces duplication and improves lookup performance
3. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between state management and UI
4. **Foundation for Undo/Redo**: The normalized structure provides a solid foundation for implementing undo/redo functionality
5. **Easier Testing**: Redux makes it easier to test state changes in isolation

## Future Enhancements

The refactoring provides a foundation for several future enhancements:

1. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Can be implemented using redux-undo
2. **Persistence**: More robust persistence with IndexedDB or server synchronization
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Further memoization and selective rendering
4. **Additional Features**: Filtering, sorting, and searching tasks

## Migration Notes

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility with the existing UI and user experience. The application should function identically from the user's perspective, but with improved performance and maintainability.
